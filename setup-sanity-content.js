- Build an emergency fund (start with $1,000)

**Automate Your Success**
- Set up automatic transfers to savings
- Automate bill payments to avoid late fees
- Use apps to round up purchases and save the change

**Invest in Your Future**
- Start investing early, even with small amounts
- Take advantage of employer 401(k) matching
- Consider low-cost index funds for beginners

**Protect What You Build**
- Get adequate insurance coverage
- Keep important documents organized
- Review and update your financial plan annually
