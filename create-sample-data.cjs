**Start with the Basics**
- Track your spending for one month
- Create a simple budget (50/30/20 rule works great)
- Build an emergency fund (start with $1,000)

**Automate Your Success**
- Set up automatic transfers to savings
- Automate bill payments to avoid late fees
- Use apps to round up purchases and save the change

**Invest in Your Future**
- Start investing early, even with small amounts
- Take advantage of employer 401(k) matching
- Consider low-cost index funds for beginners

**Protect What You Build**
- Get adequate insurance coverage
- Keep important documents organized
- Review and update your financial plan annually

Remember: Financial wellness is a journey, not a destination. Small, consistent actions compound over time to create significant results.`,
